# Decision procedures for linear integer arithmetic.
This project is a study into decision procedures for linear integer arithmetic, 
also known as weak integer arithmetic and Presburger arithmetic. A useful 
introduction is given by [1].

## 1. The Presburger-Cooper algorithm.
This algorithm is based on the description by Reddy and Loveland [2], which 
constitutes an improvement over the algorithm given by Cooper, which in 
turn is a big improvement over the original procedure by Presburger.
The algorithm gives an effective decision procedure for formulae in the 
structure `(Z, â‰¤, +, 0, 1)` using existential quantifier elimination (supported 
by a divisibility predicate). The procedure should be capable of producing a 
constructive proof of any closed formula or its negation.

## 2. Solutions in a regular language.
This algorithm uses results from automata theory together with the observation 
that the elementary relations in weak arithmetic can be decided using automata.
For reference, see for example [3]. I believe this approach is easier to prove 
formally, and I find it more elegant. Furthermore, there already exist several 
optimizations and extensions that make this a more efficient and powerful 
approach than quantifier elimination.

### 2.1. A naive approach.
I first construct a decision procedure using a naive approach: translating
formulae into a language with an addition relation `A(x, y, z) <-> x + y = z`
and the usual equality and inequality relations. It should be straightforward to
apply the automata-based decision method to these formulae.

### 2.1. Basic optimizations.
The most important optimization is using more sophisticated automata that 
represent Diophantine equations, as shown in [3]. It is still unclear if a 
verified implementation of this algorithm in Coq will be efficient enough to 
compute actual examples (the theoretical nature of Coq is a severe limitation 
for computation efficiency).
